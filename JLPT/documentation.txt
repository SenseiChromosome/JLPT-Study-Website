Lesson Back-end devlopment:

*I added a home button to the Hiragana page that allows you to go to the home.
*I created a homepage where the user can select weather they do Hiragana or katakana.

Lesson Occupational Specialism: 

*I have created the katakana page with working katakana characters appearing, the user can now do both hiragana and katakana characters.
*I have finished adding 3 boxes that allow people to choose what they would like to do i.e. look at the characters, Study, Vocab.
*In addition I have added Kanji to the list so it's no longer just Hiragana and Katakana but now how Kanji as well.
*Score no longer resets after pressing enter on a empty input box, before the score would reset and say incorrect if you enter a value of nothing.
